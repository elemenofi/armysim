1. The Dirty War

This is a RPG game in which you find yourself starting a military career in a fictional 
nation within the political climate of the 1960’s/70’s. The objective is to become Commander in Chief.

The focus of the game is to simulate the internal conflict within an army in which 
different factions plot against each other to accumulate as much power as possible.
External factors are simplified and streamlined to narrow gameplay to the world of 
military progression through diplomacy and intrigue. Conventional military engagements 
are a last resort and often the worst possible outcome.

2. Officers

Officers are the core element of the game. Each officer has a set of attributes and 
traits that defines their motivations and the way they interact with the rest. 

3. Actions and Events

Actions and events move the game forward. Sometimes an action triggers an event or 
sometimes an event gives the opportunity to take an action. Some actions are only 
available to the player and some are only available to the NPCs.

4. Attributes

Diplomacy: Determines the effectiveness of the officer at creating relationships.
Intrigue: Determines the effectiveness of the officer at plotting and scheming.
Administration: Determines the effectiveness of the officer at administering resources.
Military: Determines the effectiveness of the officer at executing military operations.

5. Traits

Traits mainly affect NPC’s and determine the way in which they relate with the rest of the army.

6. Style

Officers can choose to have a hands-on or hands-off approach to commanding their unit. 
Each style has different pros and cons but generally hands-on command makes the officer 
progress faster in whichever attribute they are focusing and hands-off command frees the 
officer from daily duties in order to focus in gaining power and climbing the ranks.
