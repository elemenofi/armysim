The game centers in the peace time hierarchical structure of an army.
The goal is to reach the highest possible rank and become the most prestigious commander in the army's history.
There are two attributes contributing to the effectiveness of an officer: commanding and intelligence.
Prestige determines the seniority of equal rank officers.
Operations basically represent the way in which the player interacts with the world.
