The player is prompted with dialogs which may be related to different events.
Most of them will eventually become an order or maybe it is a quick, in the spot, decision.
The game centers in the peace time hierarchical structure of an army.
The player starts off as a Lieutenant but must first decide its specialization.
The goal is to reach the highest possible rank and become the most prestigious commander in the army's history.
The army is the martial institution of a parliamentary monarchy.
The kingdom rules over an island.
There are two attributes contributing to the effectiveness of an officer: commanding and intelligence.
Prestige determines the seniority of equal rank officers.
Operations basically represent the way in which the player interacts with the world.
It can be an internal operation to the unit such as intensive training.
But usually operations will have a commander, target/s, strength, type, documents, attached officers and so on.
Officers which command over its previous superior's post have increased troop loyalty.
Officers may be switched over to the far side of the structure when promotions happen.
A smart officer will try to secure a spot close to where he was before in order to build strength.
