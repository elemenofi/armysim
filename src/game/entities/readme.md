you have to discover one another

and you start by looking into someones trash

the more type of military elements the more people you need the more powerful it is

that prevents a general from doing shit everywhere

as a lieutenant you can start with one of the paths 

that will guide you to the generalato. but you will have

to make friends to support you in your weaker areas.
