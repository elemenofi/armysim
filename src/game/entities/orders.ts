    description: `
      <p>Congratulations on the promotion.</p>
      <p>The President is optimistic about the future but warns us about the dangers of extremist ideologies and sectarian rivalries. The Army should show society what order and discipline means. There can be no mistakes. It must be an example of public service and republicanism. We cannot let the right or left wing seize control of our armed institutions.</p>
      <p>This document represents your promotion to the rank of General and your comission as Commander in Chief of the National Army. Your orders are to keep the Army functioning efficiently and to defend the Constitution.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</br>
      John Stockenhaim</br>
      Minister of Defence</p>
